# Summary
Through Break Through Tech's Machine Learning Foundations Course, I implemented a machine learning model that predicts whether a host will respond within 
24 hours of a request/inquiry or not. This prediction model will benefit the requester if they are in a rush to book a listing, and it also may 
provide the requester an idea of how the host may respond in an emergency. Within the Jupyter Notebook, I practiced exploratory data analysis techniques
to investigate my AirBNB dataset. I prepared my data to build a model data suitable for predicting AirBNB host response rate.
